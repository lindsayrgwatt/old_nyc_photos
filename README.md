# Old NYC Photos

A few years ago I bought an Inkplate eInk screen. I finally rigged it up and use it to display some beautiful old images of NYC in transition.

Include a few things in this repository:

1. Python code to download some images and resize them for the inkplate
2. An arduino sketch to show the images on the Inkplate
3. An Openscad file to create a case for the Inkplate

Enjoy!
